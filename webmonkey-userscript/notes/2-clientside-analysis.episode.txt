          "standard": "We don’t want to send the message that criticizing us on Twitter is a ticket to the podcast...but that’s what climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis did, and now here she is. Kendra had some issues with our climate episode on Apple TV+, so Jon invited her on for a conversation. And just like our planet, things heated up—insofar as you can call a thoughtful exchange of ideas “heated up.” Jon is also joined by writers Rob Christensen and Tocarra Mallard to talk about Twitter trolls, beard maintenance, and the importance of a steady government job.\n\n\n\n\nJon recorded this episode away from the studio, so if it sounds like he’s talking into a paper cup tied to a string it’s because he actually might be. Please excuse the sound issues.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of our episode? Give our hotline a call and leave your questions, comments, or thoughts: 1-212-634-7222.\n\n\n\n\nTo watch our latest episode, visit https://theproblem.link/AppleTV\n\n\n\n\nCREDITS\n\nHosted by: Jon Stewart\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing, in order of appearance: Tocarra Mallard, Rob Christensen, Kendra Pierre-Louis\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Produced by Jon Stewart, Brinda Adhikari, James Dixon, Chris McShane, and Richard Plepler.\n\nLead Producer: Sophie Erickson\n\nProducers: Caity Gray, Robby Slowik\n\n\n\n\nAssoc.

  "description": "We don’t want to send the message that criticizing us on Twitter is a ticket to the podcast...but that’s what climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis did, and now here she is. Kendra had some issues with our climate episode on Apple TV+, so Jon invited her on for a conversation. And just like our planet, things heated up—insofar as you can call a thoughtful exchange of ideas “heated up.” Jon is also joined by writers Rob Christensen and Tocarra Mallard to talk about Twitter trolls, beard maintenance, and the importance of a steady government job.\n\n\n\n\nJon recorded this episode away from the studio, so if it sounds like he’s talking into a paper cup tied to a string it’s because he actually might be. Please excuse the sound issues.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of our episode? Give our hotline a call and leave your questions, comments, or thoughts: 1-212-634-7222.\n\n\n\n\nTo watch our latest episode, visit https://theproblem.link/AppleTV\n\n\n\n\nCREDITS\n\nHosted by: Jon Stewart\n\n\n\n\nFeaturing, in order of appearance: Tocarra Mallard, Rob Christensen, Kendra Pierre-Louis\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Produced by Jon Stewart, Brinda Adhikari, James Dixon, Chris McShane, and Richard Plepler.\n\nLead Producer: Sophie Erickson\n\nProducers: Caity Gray, Robby Slowik\n\n\n\n\nAssoc. Producer: Andrea Betanzos\n\nSound Designer & Audio Engineer: Miguel Carrascal\n\nSenior Digital Producer: Kwame Opam\n\nDigital Coordinator: Norma Hernandez\n\nSupervising Producer: Lorrie Baranek\n\nHead Writer: Kris Acimovic\n\nElements: Kenneth Hull, Daniella Philipson\n\nTalent: Brittany Mehmedovic, Haley Denzak\n\nResearch: Susan Helvenston, Andy Crystal, Anne Bennett, Deniz Çam, Harjyot Ron Singh\n\n\n\n\nTheme Music by: Gary Clark Jr.\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem With Jon Stewart podcast is an Apple TV+ podcast produced by Busboy Productions.\n\nhttps://apple.co/-JonStewart",
