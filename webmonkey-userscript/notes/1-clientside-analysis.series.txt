Not to mention their recommendations for the cleanest restrooms in New York City.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWords in this episode you may not know but should know:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArbitrage is exploiting a price difference of the same asset. It’s like buying avocados at the supermarket for $1 each and selling them at the hipster farmers market for double.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOptions trading is buying and selling of options, which are essentially contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date. It’s basically betting on a stock price going up or down. So if you purchase an option instead of buying a stock, it means that you are buying the option to buy a stock if it hits a certain price. This can lead to issues, because if your bet fails, you’ve lost all that you’ve invested. Whereas if you bought actual stocks, regardless of the price, you still own that asset.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayment for order flow (PFOF) is when brokerages such as Robinhood route the buy and sell orders of retail investors to big market makers such as Citadel and Virtu instead of sending it directly to the stock market. This deal helps brokerages make hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRetail investors are individual, nonprofessional investors who are buying assets with their own money.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities are any tradable financial asset: stock share (equities), bonds, investment funds, pensions, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities exchanges, brokers, investment advisors, and mutual funds to create fair dealings, disclose important market information, and prevent fraud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBildungsroman isn’t relevant to our episode, but do you remember that from English class? You need to know it.

Kendra had some issues with our climate episode on Apple TV+, so Jon invited her on for a conversation. And just like our planet, things heated up—insofar as you can call a thoughtful exchange of ideas “heated up.” Jon is also joined by writers Rob Christensen and Tocarra Mallard to talk about Twitter trolls, beard maintenance, and the importance of a steady government job.\n\n\n\n\nJon recorded this episode away from the studio, so if it sounds like he’s talking into a paper cup tied to a string it’s because he actually might be.

                  "standard": "We’re back on Apple TV+ with brand-new episode “The Problem With Stocks,” and we’re celebrating on the podcast the only way we know how—by interviewing former SEC commissioner Rob Jackson. (We’re bad at celebrating.) We get his thoughts on why the market isn’t held accountable and is less regulated than casinos. Robby Slowik and Rob Christensen join Jon to give their thoughts on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and how Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy went from comedian to courageous leader. Not to mention their recommendations for the cleanest restrooms in New York City.\n\n\n\n\nWords in this episode you may not know but should know:\n\n\n\n\nArbitrage is exploiting a price difference of the same asset. It’s like buying avocados at the supermarket for $1 each and selling them at the hipster farmers market for double.\n\n\n\n\nDark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public.\n\n\n\n\nOptions trading is buying and selling of options, which are essentially contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date. It’s basically betting on a stock price going up or down. So if you purchase an option instead of buying a stock, it means that you are buying the option to buy a stock if it hits a certain price. This can lead to issues, because if your bet fails, you’ve lost all that you’ve invested. Whereas if you bought actual stocks, regardless of the price, you still own that asset.\n\n\n\n\nPayment for order flow (PFOF) is when brokerages such as Robinhood route the buy and sell orders of retail investors to big market makers such as Citadel and Virtu instead of sending it directly to the stock market. This deal helps brokerages make hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n\n\n\n\nRetail investors are individual, nonprofessional investors who are buying assets with their own money.\n\n\n\n\nSecurities are any tradable financial asset: stock share (equities), bonds, investment funds, pensions, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities exchanges, brokers, investment advisors, and mutual funds to create fair dealings, disclose important market information, and prevent fraud.\n\n\n\n\nBildungsroman isn’t relevant to our episode, but do you remember that from English class? You need to know it. Please google it.\n\n\n\n\nFor more words and definitions, visit https://theproblem.link/glossary To watch our stocks episode, visit https://theproblem.link/AppleTV\n\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

Kendra had some issues with our climate episode on Apple TV+, so Jon invited her on for a conversation. And just like our planet, things heated up—insofar as you can call a thoughtful exchange of ideas “heated up.” Jon is also joined by writers Rob Christensen and Tocarra Mallard to talk about Twitter trolls, beard maintenance, and the importance of a steady government job.\n\n\n\n\nJon recorded this episode away from the studio, so if it sounds like he’s talking into a paper cup tied to a string it’s because he actually might be. Please excuse the sound issues.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of our episode?

So we invited him on the podcast (we’re gluttons for punishment) to talk it out. Jon is also joined by writers Kris Acimovic and Kasaun Wilson to talk about rising gas prices and why comedy clubs are the only landmarks comedians know.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of our episode?

      "title": "Jon Talks Stocks and Ukraine",
      "description": "We’re back on Apple TV+ with brand-new episode “The Problem With Stocks,” and we’re celebrating on the podcast the only way we know how—by interviewing former SEC commissioner Rob Jackson. (We’re bad at celebrating.) We get his thoughts on why the market isn’t held accountable and is less regulated than casinos. Robby Slowik and Rob Christensen join Jon to give their thoughts on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and how Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy went from comedian to courageous leader. Not to mention their recommendations for the cleanest restrooms in New York City.\n\n\n\n\nWords in this episode you may not know but should know:\n\n\n\n\nArbitrage is exploiting a price difference of the same asset. It’s like buying avocados at the supermarket for $1 each and selling them at the hipster farmers market for double.\n\n\n\n\nDark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public.\n\n\n\n\nOptions trading is buying and selling of options, which are essentially contracts that give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date. It’s basically betting on a stock price going up or down. So if you purchase an option instead of buying a stock, it means that you are buying the option to buy a stock if it hits a certain price. This can lead to issues, because if your bet fails, you’ve lost all that you’ve invested. Whereas if you bought actual stocks, regardless of the price, you still own that asset.\n\n\n\n\nPayment for order flow (PFOF) is when brokerages such as Robinhood route the buy and sell orders of retail investors to big market makers such as Citadel and Virtu instead of sending it directly to the stock market. This deal helps brokerages make hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n\n\n\n\nRetail investors are individual, nonprofessional investors who are buying assets with their own money.\n\n\n\n\nSecurities are any tradable financial asset: stock share (equities), bonds, investment funds, pensions, etc.\n\n\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees securities exchanges, brokers, investment advisors, and mutual funds to create fair dealings, disclose important market information, and prevent fraud.\n\n\n\n\nBildungsroman isn’t relevant to our episode, but do you remember that from English class? You need to know it. Please google it.\n\n\n\n\nFor more words and definitions, visit https://theproblem.link/glossary To watch our stocks episode, visit https://theproblem.link/AppleTV\n\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

Now they’re here to tell Jon about a new approach to economics called Modern Monetary Theory, and why printing money maybe isn’t so bad after all.
